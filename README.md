## Installation
1. Install and setup Eclipse latest version, Since it is the convinient IDE for java importing and editing all these codes would be more easy.
2. Open a new project with any desired name, anyhow relevent name according to the naming standards of java is suggested.
3. Import / copy these 3 files into the default package.

 since this is the udp we can not clearly see the establishment of the connection, and due to lack to encryption we will be able to read the message in that chat from the captured packets directly without any decoding
 
 First message: Hey this is stanley
